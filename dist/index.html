            <p>Sixty-four people participated in this kind of testing. They were divided into couples of the same sex, and for each of them four test steps were destined. Tests included negotiations,  solving the puzzles, tests for memory and eventual public presentation of the results of these three assignments.</p>


             <p>Before experiment started, half of the couples drank coffee. The other half had to be satisfied with the usual drink without caffeine.</p>


             <p>Results of the study were interesting. Women who have consumed coffee, were able to collect puzzles almost by two minutes faster than the ladies who got a simple drink. Men struck by the fact, that after coffee they had difficulties with memory test, for the puzzles they spent twenty seconds more than their peers who drank no coffee at all.</p>
